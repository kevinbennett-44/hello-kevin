      <h1>Saga Group</h1>
      <p><strong>Defining engaging products and intuitive functionality, to delight customers and allow them to get the most out of being a Saga customer.</strong></p>
      <h2><span class="blue-label">&nbsp;Digital Product&nbsp;Manager, Design&nbsp;Lead &&nbsp;Senior&nbsp;Designer&nbsp;</span></h2>
      <p>During my time at Saga I had a number of roles - from Senior Designer through to Product Manager and Design Team Lead.</p>
      <p>Predominantly though, in each role, I used my skills to define new platforms, functionality and designs as part of a wider talented team. This covered projects such as the re-branding of Saga’s digital landscape, launching and growing a membership experience - from sign-up, account creation, repeat engagement through to redemption and transaction, and defining new functionality and products from inception, defining user, business and technical requirements to delivery.</p>
      <p>The team set-up was a familiar one. Stakeholders, Engineers, Testers, PMs, Scrum Leads and Designers and copy writers. My place in the team would vary in my time at Saga but the approach I championed was always the same.</p>
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>Saga has a broad and challenging audience and customer base. Focused at the UK’s over-50s, it’s a brand that need to appeal to women and men between 50 and 100 years old, with a wide variation in incomes, with a wide variation digital adoption, interests and mobility.</p>
      <p>Each project would require its own set of insight - qualitative or quantitative - but defining and maintaining core personas was really important. Always being mindful of our core audience and sense-checking new products against a holistic view of our customers and their relationship with the brand.</p>
      <p>Regular in-person interviews, usability sessions, surveys, time spent in call centres and reviewing feedback - aligned with site analytics and session tracking - was an important foundation to the work we carried out day-to-day. Something that I helped establish early on but championed and lead later on.</p>
      <h3>Define</h3>
      <p>Throughout my time at Saga I worked hard to foster a good collaborative team culture that would research, define and discover solutions together. This meant a lot of time handled round white boards, brain-storming in the coffee shop, or pouring over wireframes and design files.</p>
      <p>I believe this approach lead to better solutions, ones defined by subject-matter experts, not just business stakeholders.</p>

        <span>Design for trust.</span>

      <p>Highlight features and projects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="li-sml">Re-imaging the Saga Member’s experience.</li>
        <li class="li-sml">Defining, building and delivery of new products and functionality.</li>

        <li class="li-sml">Design an engaging content experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Test. Iterate. Repeat.</h3>
      <p>It was important to me that products and experiences didn’t stale - constantly questioning the value any feature or product played in the overall experience.</p>
      <p>I always worked closely with UAT testers and engineers to ensure the best builds and designs we could, but with a practical approach to detail and delivery. I felt it was important that the products we worked be tested and proven in ‘real-life’ early and often.</p>
      <h3>Finally...</h3>
      <p>During my time at Saga I had the opportunity to work with some very talented people. It allowed me to define and hone the practises and processes I believe in to make good digital products.</p>
      <p>Time spent as senior designer, focusing on UI and experience was time spent learning and developing. But it was as team and product lead that I could really apply my holistic approach to product management and really influence and build a collaborative approach to problem solving that continue to build on today.</p>
